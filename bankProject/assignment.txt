Project Focus:
-The focus of this project is on the deployment of data structures
-Try to design the best and most efficient structure for the given problem
-The classes should be designed to use efficient and meaningful inheritance 
-No piece of the program should be recoded. Use overriding as required
-Pay attention to inheritance vs compostition ("is" vs "has" relation) and avoid unecessary inheritance
-Define the access level of the variables efficiently. Each variable should be only directly accessible in necessary areas
-Any action should be followed with a reasonable message to describe the service and result of it
-The layout and design of the output should also be clear for the user
